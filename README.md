# A partial list of Ressources that helped me through my journey as a Software Engineer in robotics and Embedded Systems development

## First of all you must learn a programming language: 
Python -> easy to use and fast learning curve (lot of libs free to use)<br>
C++ -> Harder and longer to learn/use but necessary when building complex library dependancies<br>
C -> If you want to manage at hardware level everything (comes after)<br>


## Then you go for ROS:
https://www.ros.org/ <br>
https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html<br>

## Then you must learn how to make your robot react to your environnment:
https://opencv.org/<br>
https://pointclouds.org/<br>

## Then you can go for a planning framework:
https://moveit.ros.org/<br>
https://ompl.kavrakilab.org/<br>

special mention to this repo very instructive and helpfull: 
https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRobotics <br>

## Then you can start prospecting for 3D sensors that have a straightforward integration with ROS:
https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros <br>
https://www.stereolabs.com/docs <br>

## Additionnal Points you can learn of how to use arduino and small sensors:
http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Arduino%20IDE%20Setup <br>
https://micro.ros.org/ <br>

## Theoretical aspects, Springer Handbook of Robotics:
