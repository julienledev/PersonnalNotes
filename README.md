# A Partial List of Resources without context That Helped Me Through My Journey as a Software Engineer in Robotics and Embedded Systems Development

## First of all, you must learn a programming language:
Python -> easy to use and fast learning curve (lots of free libraries to use)<br>
C++ -> Harder and longer to learn/use but necessary when building complex library dependencies<br>
C -> If you want to manage everything at the hardware level (comes after)<br>

## Then you go for ROS:
[ROS](https://www.ros.org/)<br>
[ROS Documentation](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html)<br>

## Then you must learn how to make your robot react to your environment:
[OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)<br>
[Point Cloud Library](https://pointclouds.org/)<br>

## Then you can go for a planning framework:
[MoveIt](https://moveit.ros.org/)<br>
[OMPL](https://ompl.kavrakilab.org/)<br>

Special mention to this repository, very instructive and helpful:
[PythonRobotics by AtsushiSakai](https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRobotics)<br>

## Then you can start prospecting for 3D sensors that have straightforward integration with ROS:
[Intel RealSense ROS](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros)<br>
[Stereolabs Documentation](https://www.stereolabs.com/docs)<br>

## Additional points you can learn about how to use Arduino and small sensors:
[Rosserial Arduino Tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Arduino%20IDE%20Setup)<br>
[Micro-ROS](https://micro.ros.org/)<br>

## Theoretical aspects, Springer Handbook of Robotics:
[Springer Handbook of Robotics](https://www.amazon.com/Springer-Handbook-Robotics-Handbooks/dp/3319325507)<br>

## Then you can go in depth with additionnal robotics ressources:
[Robotics Toolbox for Python](https://github.com/petercorke/robotics-toolbox-python)
