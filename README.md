# A partial list of Ressources that helped me through my journey as a Software Engineer in robotics and Embedded Systems development

## First of all you must learn a programming language:
Python -> easy to use and fast learning curve (lot of libs free to use)
C++ -> Harder and longer to learn/use but necessary when building complex library dependancies
C -> If you want to manage at hardware level everything (comes after)


## Then you go for ROS:
https://www.ros.org/
https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html

## Then you must learn how to make your robot react to your environnment:
https://opencv.org/
https://pointclouds.org/

## Then you can go for a planning framework:
https://moveit.ros.org/
https://ompl.kavrakilab.org/


## Additionnal Points you can learn of how to use arduino and small sensors:

https://micro.ros.org/
